![This is what this looks like.](https://github.com/mattdelsordo/fantasy-name-generator/blob/master/example.png?raw=true)

Stanford PhD studen Andrej Karpathy [trained a recurrent neural network on thousands of baby names](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) resulting in a list of human sounding but not real names. This little program compiles these names together randomly with actual human names to help you name your next Dungeons and Dragons or Elder Scrolls character.

Caveat: as of right now there's a like 1/1000 chance of it running a prank program that I put in to pull a goof on my dungeon master friend, try to ignore it until I remove it.
