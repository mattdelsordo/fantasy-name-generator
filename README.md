Stanford PhD student Andrej Karpathy [trained a recurrent neural network on thousands of baby names](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) resulting in a list of human sounding but not real names. This little program compiles these names together randomly with actual human names to help you name your next Dungeons and Dragons or Elder Scrolls character.
